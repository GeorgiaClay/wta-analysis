## WTA Analysis

An exploratory analysis of data from the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) carried out with Python in VS Code, looking at questions such as: 

1. How has the number of professional women tennis players changed across the time period covered by the dataset (1848-2023)?
2. Which countries are most heavily represented by these players?
3. Who have been the most successful players in 2023 and how successful have they been?
4. How much movement has there been in the rankings over 2023: have the top 5 at the start of 2023 managed to maintain their rankings?
5. Comeback analysis: How often do players come back from a set down to win, and who are the biggest comeback queens of the year?

I also build a Logistic Regression Classifier to predict match outcomes using scikit-learn.
